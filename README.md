This is a repository for the [Spatial Data on the Web Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2021/sdw/), a collaborative project between [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) and [OGC](https://ogc.org/).

This repository has been factored out as a submodule of the original repository at [https://github.com/w3c/sdw](https://github.com/w3c/sdw).
