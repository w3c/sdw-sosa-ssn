      <p>This section consists of longer examples that represent complex use cases of the SOSA ontology. Several make use of
      fictitious and explicitly named identifiers to aid in clarity and readability. We use the word <i>Platform</i> in this
      section to align to SOSA nomenclature even through in vernacular and commercial speech nearly all devices are referred to as a
      &quot;Sensors&quot;.</p>
      <p>This section is non-normative.</p>

      <h3>Ontology definition of IBS-TH2 Temperature and Humidity Sensor</h3>

      <p> Many of the implementations of [[[#examples]]] deal
      with permanent deployments of a purpose built device that are declaratively described as one-off instances.This example
      deals with a standardized <a href="#SOSAPlatform">sosa:Plaform</a> of which thousands of instances have been mass produced and
      that will be deployed multiple times by individuals for various purposes. This justifies some additional ontological work, as
      per [[[##SOSASystem-instances]], in order to maximize information
      reuse.</p>
<p>An RDF file containing a <a
            href="https://github.com/w3c/sdw/blob/gh-pages/ssn/integrated/informativeExamples/InkBird-IBS-TH2.ttl">graph corresponding to
            this example is available</a>. </p>

      <p>The IBS-TH2 is a consumer grade temperature and humidity measurement product that is commercially available at the time of
      this publication. It also has the capacity to report the &quot;health&quot; of it's user-replaceable battery in terms of a
      percentage. Intended to be a wireless and easy to deploy device, the IBS-TH2 reports its observations using a Bluetooth Low
      Energy data-link that is not modeled as part of this exemplar.</p>
      
      <p>This specific example models the IBS-TH2 as an ontological <i>conceptual</i> device.  The ontology includes all of the
      characteristics common to all IBS-TH2 devices from which instances can be created for each new device manufactured. 
      This means that the main device class, &lt;InkBird-IBS-TH2&gt;, is a sub class of a <a href="#SOSAPlatform">sosa:Plaform</a>
      rather than an instance of a <a href="#SOSAPlatform">sosa:Plaform</a>. This is also true for the three Sensors
     hosted by the Platform: &lt;IBSTH2TemperatureSensor&gt;, &lt;IBSTH2HumiditySensor&gt; and
      &lt;IBSTH2BatteryVoltageSensor&gt;, all of which are sub classes of <a href="#SOSASensor">sosa:Sensor</a>. This is done so
      that the sensors may be individually instantiated for each instance of an IBS-TH2 device. As classes, they model the nominal 
      performance and behaviors of each individual sensor within the platform.</p>
      
      <p>This mechanism is often criticized as redundant by practitioners used to dealing with implicit models within application. 
      In this case, the ability to instantiate the sub-components of <a href="#SOSAPlatform">sosa:Plaform</a>s and their instances,
      enables both the documentation of <a href="#SOSASensor">sosa:Sensor</a> reuse within designs and the recording of individual
      sensor idiosyncrasies due to manufacturing variance, defects, configuration changes, or outright wear and tear.</p>
      
      <p>A full ontological representation of the IBS-TH2 reads as:</p>

        <pre class="example" data-include="./integrated/informativeExamples/InkBird-IBS-TH2.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

      <p>The ontology also encodes the operating limits and accuracies of each sensor within the platform as described by the manufacturer in their
      commercial literature. This document, the primary source for these values, is directly referenced in the <a href="#SOSAProcedure">sosa:Procedure</a>
      node of the ontology as a means of providing transparency. The ability of SOSA to encode the sensor operating characteristics and limitations as part of
      the machine readable ontological definition is a great asset for both operations and deployment.</p>
      
      <p>Operationally, this allows for sophisticated data consumers to evaluate data quality and predict future measurement
      performance based on the nominal sensors limits.  An example is the problem of software libraries reporting numbers with an
      impossible number of decimal digits due to internal binary representations.  The sensor accuracy properties can be used to
      truncate these numbers at the appropriate significant digit. Another related problem that this approach can prevent is the
      use of poorly documented &quot;Magic Values&quot; or &quot;Fill Values&quot; to represent sensor failure or miscalibration, which
      can be (and have been) misinterpreted as actual data by other data consumers. The use of machine readable sensor specifications preempts
      these situations by explicitly informing the consumer of exceptions.</p>
      
      <p>From a deployment perspective, the encoding of performance and behavior data in a machine readable way is of significant
value when selecting platforms or sensors for specific tasks.  Depending on the task specifications, a working set of <a
href="#SOSAPlatorm">sosa:Platform</a>s, <a href="#SOSASensor">sosa:Sensor</a>s or <a href="#SOSASystem">sosa:System</a>s can be
queried from triple stores for detailed consideration.  The advent of semantically enabled e-commerce vocabularies such as <a
href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a> and <a href="https://www.gs1.org/voc/">GS1 Webvoc</a> show great promise for
this approach to computer-aided manufacturing and sourcing.</a>


        
        <p>A simple instantiation of a specific sensor would be:</p>
        <pre>_:InkBird-IBS-TH2/9885 a equipment:InkBird-IBS-TH2 ;
        rdfs:label "InkBird Sensor that Bob bought."@en ;
        sosa:hosts _:InkBird-IBS-TH2-BatterySensor/9885;
        sosa:hosts _:InkBird-IBS-TH2-HumiditySensor/9885;
        sosa:hosts _:InkBird-IBS-TH2-TemperatureSensor/9985;
        gs1:hasSerialNumber "9885" ;
        equipment:deviceAddress "12:34:56:12:34:56" .
        </pre>        
        
        <p>Note that because the IBS-TH2 is instantiated, so are all of the hosted <a href="#SOSASensor">sosa:Sensor</a>s on the <a
href="#SOSAPlatform">sosa:Platform</a>.  While this seems to be initially redundant, these instances represent the actual physical
sensors on that specific physical platform instance along with their performance idiosyncrasies or configuration.  This makes it
possible to record device-level deviations from expected nominal performance and perform deployment analyses on, for example,
battery life performance of individual battery lots.</p>

    <h3>Tracking Beer temperature</h3>

    <p>An RDF file containing a <a
            href="https://github.com/w3c/sdw/blob/gh-pages/ssn/integrated/informativeExamples/InkBird-IBS-TH2-instance.ttl">graph corresponding to

     <p>The following is a detailed example where a IBS-TH2 sensor is used to monitor a crate (carton) of beers from the time of its
     packaging at a brewery up until its display in the supermarket cooler where it is ready to be purchased. Brewers will on occasion insert a temperature logger into their shipping process as part of their quality control program and we present such a hypothetical situation
     here.</p>

      <figcaption>Logging the humidity and temperature of beer from packaging to display cooler.</figcaption> 
     </figure>
     
     <p>Beer degrades both
     at high and low temperatures.  This requires that it be kept cool during storage and shipping to preserve the
     product. Humidity has no effect on beer owing to sealed containers, but excess humidity will weaken cardboard and degrade
     the adhesives potentially resulting in product breakage.  Brewers will on occasion insert a temperature logger into
     their shipping process as part of their quality control program and we present such a hypothetical situation here.<p>

     <p>This example is of interest because it involves the repurposing of a commodity, consumer-grade <a
     href="#SOSAPlatform">sosa:Platform</a> to a domain specific problem, the physical movement of a platform from environment to
     environment and the possible ambiguity of data-ownership in each of these environments.</p>

     <p>Alice works for Acme Brewery Co. She procures an InkBird IBS-TH2 Platform (S/N: 12345) and places it inside a beer carton with six
     bottles (a &quot;six-pack&quot;) of Acme Brewery's famous Porter beers with a product lot code of PO202402. She seals the packaging and places it inside of Acme

     <p>We make use of the [[[prov-o]]] as a mechanism to model the packaging activity and the placement of the Platform into the

   <p>In the above example the concurrent use of <a href="#SOSAhasFeatureOfInterest">sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest</a> and <a
   href="#SOSAhasUltimateFeatureOfInterest">sosa:hasUltimateFeatureOfInterest</a> properties is made to account for the repurposing of a generic
   sensor. The actual measurement being performed by the platform is the air temperature within the carton as a proxy for the beer
   temperature within each beer vessel. This property allows for flexibility in the interpretation of the measurement
   within a context <i>not necessarily intended by the original sensor design itself</i>. Modeling the full thermodynamics activity relating one measurement to the other is beyond the
   scope of this document but could be implemented as a second order &quot;virtual&quot; <a href="#SOSASensor">sosa:Sensor</a> or a

   <p>Physically, both &lt;HumiditySensor/12345&gt; and &lt;TemperatureSensor/12345&gt; are monitoring a sample of the ambient air within the
   specific Porter carton which we define as &lt;acmePorterSixPackAirSample/01/00000000000000/10/PO202402/21/0001&gt;. This sample only exists on a
   virtual basis for the purpose of the measurement, but it does set the context of the measurement to be
   within the specific instance of a beer carton. The <a href="#SOSAhasUltimateFeatureOfInterest">sosa:hasUltimateFeatureOfInterest</a> property
   then targets the beer temperature within that carton and the humidity the cardboard of the carton was subject to.</p>

   <p>The SOSA ontology takes a &quot;feature and property&quot; approach to recording observations. The
   feature of interest, in this case the ambient air within the carton &lt;acmePorterSixPackAirSample/01/00000000000000/10/PO202402/21/0001&gt; is
   the feature that the Platform is manufactured to physically measure. However, it really is a proxy for both the temperature of the beer within the
   individual containers &lt;acmePorterSixPackBeerSample/01/00000000000000/10/PO202402/21/0001&gt; within the carton and the relative humidity that
   the packaging &lt;ProductPackaging/1&gt; is being exposed to. As with the air sample, the beer &quot;sample&quot; is virtual; the node
   serves only to semantically link the observation to the beer liquid itself without any physical sample being taken.</p>

    <p>The sensors of the platform are reporting values for the same properties of the same features of interest. The change in physical
    location of the carton of beer does not effect the process because the platform monitors the inside of the carton itself. Modeling
    the location of the carton, its containment by other objects and the process of (un)loading of the carton from the truck is done through other rdf nodes
    not show in this example.</p> 

    <p>The physical location of the truck itself is reported by a separate vehicle tracking or delivery scheduling application not
    shown here. The refrigeration on board monitoring system does reference this node as the location at which the reading was
    received as a convenience.</p> 

     <p class="note">Locations of Platform, Sensors, and measured samples are often conflated in non-semantically enabled systems
     and the semantics are often implicitly assumed by the application.  The deep semantic modeling within SOSA makes no such
     implicit assumptions and locations can be assigned to all elements independently.</p>

      <h3>Notes on deployment and observation aggregation</h3>
      
      <p>In previous examples, a [[[prov-o]]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/Activity">prov:Activity</a> was used as a means of aggregating
      results as an archiving mechanism. Other mechanisms exists to define the tasking of a Platform and to aggregate collections of
      results within specific contexts. </p>

      
      <h4>Recording data and sensor tasking through sensor deployments</h4>
      
      <p>Sosa provides a <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Deployment">Deployment</a> class that deals with the current purpose of
      the Platform. This permits the tasking or installation of sensors to different environments, purposes, locations or leasees.  Intended to
      link Platforms to Systems, this allows the application of different semantics to different situations, for example by recording
      different configuration parameters or leases to different customers. There is no restriction on concurrent deployments which
      allows multiple tasks to be completed simultaneously. Reusing the example of [[[#beerTemp]]], the
      sensor can be seen to be concurrently deployed within the beer carton and multiple coolers / storage sites:</p>
      
      <pre class="example"># Make coolers and carton a sosa:Platform.

      <h4 id="beerCollections">Recording data using observation collection</h4>

      <p>Sosa provides a lightweight capability to aggregate members for convenience. In previous examples observations where
      clustered according to Deployment or recording Activity. In some circumstances it is useful to aggregate observations
      according to an ad-hoc classification, here following the location storage of the carton while dispensing with geo-spatial
      data:</p>
      
      <pre class="example">#All data from the carton
&lt;acmePorterSixPackObservations/1&gt; a sosa:ObservationCollection;
    prov:generated &lt;observation/1a&gt;, &lt;observation/1b&gt;, &lt;observation/1c&gt; ;

    <p>A similar class <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/SampleCollection">sosa:SampleCollection</a> allows for the aggregation of <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Sample">sosa:Sample</a>s. Here samples collected as part of a
    quality assurance program are assigned to their own collection. In the case of Amce Brewery, a collection of beer samples could be represented in this manner:</p>
