<section id="rdf-notation">
    <h3>RDF notation</h3>
    <p>
        The SSN Ontology is defined using RDFS [[rdf-schema]] and OWL [[owl2-overview]] using its RDF representation
        [[owl2-rdf-based-semantics]].
    </p>
    <p>
        There are several RDF serializations available.
        The choice of RDF serialization is not prescribed by this specification.
        In this document, RDF fragments and examples are shown primarily using the compact Turtle notation
        [[rdf12-turtle]], with options for JSON-LD [[json-ld11]] in some places.
        OWL Restrictions are shown using the Manchester Syntax [[owl2-manchester-syntax]]

        <h4>Module diagrams</h4>

        <p>
            Module diagrams use a notation similar to UML Package Diagrams [[uml]], with folders for modules, and dashed
            directed connectors for dependencies between them.
            However the module diagrams MUST NOT be interpreted according to strict UML rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: Dependencies are implemented in the RDF representation of SSN using <code>owl:imports</code>.

        <p>
            Class diagrams are informative.

        <p>
            Class and property diagrams use a notation similar to UML Class Diagrams [[uml]], with boxes for classes,
            and labelled directed connectors (associations) or class attributes for properties.
            However the class diagrams MUST NOT be interpreted according to strict UML rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            In particular:
            <br>- Cardinalities are not shown and should not be inferred
            <br>- Object properties are generally shown as association roles. Exceptions are (i) if a target class is
            unspecified (ii) to reduce clutter, in which case object properties appear as class attributes, alongside
            the datatype properties
        </p>
        <p>
            Classes and properties coloured grey are included in a diagram for context, but are described in
            a different section of the document
        </p>
        <p>
            Connectors with open arrowheads indicate sub-class relationships, however it should be noted that these are
            not defined in the SOSA modules.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of the diagrams is primarily to orient the reader as to how SSN properties are related to the
            SSN classes for most purposes.
            The associations shown in the diagrams match the soft axioms <code>schema:domainIncludes</code> and
            <code>schema:rangeIncludes</code> in the ontology.
            However, in any diagram the associations and attributes are not exhaustive: other associations exist but are
            not shown where their presence in the diagram would distract from the primary message.
