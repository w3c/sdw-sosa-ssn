    <h2>Common Modeling Questions</h2>
    This section informally discusses how to handle common modeling questions such as locations, forecasts, and
    quantity
    values with a unit of measure.

    <section id="location">
      <h3>Location</h3>
      <p>Many of the key classes provided by SOSA and SSN represent entities that can be located in space such as
        sensors, features of interest, actuators, samples, and so forth, or activities that can be located via their
        participating entities, e.g., platforms.
        These entities will usually be described using models and ontologies defined for application domains, including
        technical disciplines, social and business contexts.
        In these contexts there are a number of implementations that support the expression of spatial properties,
        including location.
        These are discussed further in the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices note [[SDW-BP]]. </p>
      <p>In particular, GeoSPARQL [[GeoSPARQL]] provides a flexible and relatively complete platform for geospatial
        objects, that fosters interoperability between geo-datasets. To do so, these entities can be declared as
        instances of geo:Feature and geometries can be assigned to them via the geo:hasGeometry property.
        In case of classes, e.g., specific features of interests such as rivers, these can be defined as subclasses of
        geo:Feature.</p>
      <p>For example, if observations are made of the atmosphere at a specific location, it might be described as a
        Sample using the following pattern:</p>
      <pre class="example" data-include="./examples/2023ex1.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

    </section>

    <section id="forecasts" class="informative">
      <h3>Forecasts</h3>
      <p>One may also represent forecasts as observations if the value of <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code> is later in
        time than the <code>sosa:resultTime</code>.
        Given the definition of these terms, it means that: <em>The time when the Observation act was completed is
          before the time that the Result of the observation applies to the FeatureOfInterest.</em></p>
      <p class="note"> Other means to represent forecasts are reported, but not in the scope of this specification.
        For example [[Lefrancois-et-al-2017]] derives the SSN <code>Sensing/Sensor/Observation</code>
        pattern and define <code>Forecasting/Forecaster/Forecast</code> classes.</p>
      <p class="note">Describing a plan for some actuation or observation in the future is not covered by this
        specification.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="quantity-values-and-unit-of-measures" class="informative">
      <h3>Quantity Values and Unit of Measures</h3>
      <p>The result of an <a href="#SOSAObservation"><code>sosa:Observation</code></a> or an <a
          href="#SOSAActuation"><code>sosa:Actuation</code></a> can be a quantity value with a numeric value and a unit
        of measure.

      <p class="note">It is not in the scope of this specification to recommend any particular way of expressing results
        as quantity values.
        There exist external vocabularies that are specifically designed for modeling quantity values as OWL
        individuals, or as datatypes.
        Examples include the Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies (QUDT, [[QUDT]]) the Ontology of
        Units of Measure (OM, [[Rijgersberg-et-al-2013]]), and the St Etienne School of Mines <i>Custom Datatypes</i>
        (CDT, [[CDT]]). </p>
      <ul>
        <li>With QUDT, a quantitative result would be a <a href="http://qudt.org/"><code>qudt:QuantityValue</code></a>
        </li>
        <li>With OM 2, a quantitative result would be a <a
            href="http://www.wurvoc.org/vocabularies/"><code>om:Measure</code> or <code>om:Point</code></a></li>
        <li>With CDT, the value of <a href="#SOSAhasSimpleResult"><code>sosa:hasSimpleResult</code></a> may be
          structured to match <a
            href="https://ci.mines-stetienne.fr/lindt/v4/custom_datatypes#ucum"><code>cdt:ucum</code></a> which
          encodes
          the unit-of-measure using UCUM (UCUM, [[UCUM]])</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">Custom datatypes are not strictly compatible with OWL, which restricts the set of datatypes that
        can be used. See sec. 5.2 in [[owl2-syntax]] for more details.</p>

    <section id="SOSAProperty-instances" class="informative">
      <h3>Generic or Specific Instances of sosa:Property</h3>
      <p>The previous version of SOSA/SSN left an ambiguity on whether an instance of <a
          href="#SOSAProperty"><code>sosa:Property</code></a> should be generic to all features of interest (e.g.,
        <code>ex:Temperature</code>,
        <code>ex:OnOffStatus</code>), or specific to a single feature of interest (e.g.,
        <code>&lt;myBodyTemperature&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;LightStatus&gt;</code>). This version solves the ambiguity
        by
        differentiating:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#SOSAProperty"><code>sosa:Property</code></a> for the former case</li>
        <li><a href="#SOSAPropertyOfInterest"><code>sosa:PropertyOfInterest</code></a> for the latter case.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>


    <section id="SOSASystem-instances" class="informative">
      <h3>Generic or Specific Instances of sosa:System</h3>
      <p>This specification does not specify whether an instance of <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a>
        should be generic (e.g., <code>ex:TemperatureSensor</code>,
        <code>ex:LightActuator</code>), or specific to a single feature of interest (e.g.,
        <code>&lt;temperatureSensor/84&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;light/112&gt;</code>).
        Implementers are free to choose one way of modeling things or the other.
      </p>
      <p>On the other hand, one SHOULD NOT use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/#F12:_Punning">OWL
          punning</a> to make <code>ex:Temperature</code> denote both a subclass of
        <a href="#SOSAProperty"><code>sosa:Property</code></a> and an instance of sosa:Property. In fact, merging the
        two examples below in a
        single RDF Graph would make an OWL reasoner infer that <code>ex:TemperatureSensor</code>,
        <code>&lt;TemperatureSensor/1&gt;</code>, and
        <code>&lt;TemperatureSensor/2&gt;</code>, denote the same individual.
      </p>
      <p>This also holds for subclasses of <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a>: <a
          href="#SOSASensor"><code>sosa:Sensor</code></a>, <a href="#SOSAActuator"><code>sosa:Actuator</code></a>, and
        <a href="#SOSASampler"><code>sosa:Sampler</code></a>.
      </p>
      <p>This first example is modeling instances of <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a> as generic:
      </p>
      <pre class="example" data-include="./examples/2017ex6.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
      <p>This second example is modeling instances of <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a> as specific:
      </p>
      <pre class="example" data-include="./examples/2017ex7.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
