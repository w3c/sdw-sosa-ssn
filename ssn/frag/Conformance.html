    <p>Data conforms to SSN if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Access to data is organized around <a href=https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#Actuations>Actuations</a>, <a href=https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#Observations>Observations</a> and <a href=https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#Sampling>Samplings</a>, which represent executions of Actuation, Observation and Sampling procedures, implemented by Actuators, Sensors and Samplers </li>
        <li> The contents of all data fields are expressed using the appropriate RDF classes and properties from SSN. Where no such class or property exists, sub-classes or sub-properties specializing SSN in a domain-specific web ontology are employed.</li>
        <li> All classes and properties from SSN are used in a way consistent with the semantics declared in this specification, as so any SSN sub-classes or sub-properties specialised in domain-specific ontologies used to express the concerned data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    SSN-compliant knowledge graphs MAY include additional non-SSN class instances, object and data properties, and additional RDF data.
