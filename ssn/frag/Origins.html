    <h2>Origins of SSN and SOSA</h2>
    <p>Here we briefly review the origins of SSN and SOSA, namely the initial
      SSN version published by the <em>W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator
        Group </em> [[SSNX]] and work on Sensor Web Enablement by the OGC. We
      also highlight the most substantial changes made since the initial
      release of the SSN ontology.</p>
    <p>Starting in 2002, the OGC's Sensor Web Enablement initiative has developed
      a generic framework for delivering sensor data, dealing with
      remote-sensing, moving platforms, and in-situ monitoring and sensing.
      The Sensor Observation Service defines a standard query interface for
      sensor and observation data, following the pattern established by OGC
      for their Web Services. The returned XML data conforms with the Sensor Model
      Language [[SensorML]] and OMXML [[OMXML]], whereby the latter implements
      Observations and Measurements [[OandM]]. </p>
    <p>SensorML and O&amp;M are complementary viewpoints. SensorML
      is 'provider-centric' and encodes details of the sensor along with raw
      observation data. SensorML is self-contained and highly flexible. This
      makes life easy for data producers but is demanding on consumers.
      SensorML provides extensive support for serialization of numeric data arrays
      and is particularly optimized for data that includes multiple parallel
      streams that must be processed together. For example, the data collected
      by cameras on airborne vehicles must be geo-referenced based on the
      instantaneous position of the platform and orientation of the camera. In
      contrast, O&amp;M was designed to be more 'user-centric' with the target
      of the observation and the observed property as first-class objects.
      O&amp;M works at a higher semantic level than SensorML, but only
      provides abstract classes for sensors, features of interest and
      observable properties, expecting the details to be provided by specific
      applications and domains. O&amp;M also provided a model for sampling,
      since almost all scientific observations are made on a subset of, or
      proxy for, the ultimate feature of interest. </p>
    <p>The initial <em>W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group</em>ontology
      (SSNX) was built around an ontology design pattern called the <em>Stimulus
        Sensor Observation</em> (SSO) pattern [[SSO-Pattern]]. The SSO was
      developed as a minimal and common ground for heavy-weight ontologies
      for the use on the Semantic Sensor Web as well as to explicitly
      address the need for light-weight semantics requested by the Linked
      Data community. The SSO was also aligned to the <em>Dolce-Ultralite </em>upper
      ontology (DUL). </p>
    <p>The SSN ontology described in this document is based on a revised and
      expanded version of this pattern, namely the <em>Sensor, Observation,
        Sample, and Actuator</em> (SOSA) ontology.
      Similar to SSNX, SOSA acts as a central building block for the SSN but puts more
      emphasis on light-weight use and the ability to be used standalone.
      The axiomatization also changed to provide an experience more related
      to Schema.org. Notable differences include the usage of the Schema.org
      <code>domainIncludes</code> and <code>rangeIncludes</code> annotation
      properties that provide an informal semantics compared to the
      inferential semantics of their OWL 2 counterparts. In line with the
      changes implemented for the new SSN, SOSA also drops the direct DUL
      alignment although an optional alignment can be achieved via the
      SSN-DUL alignment provided in <a href="#DUL-alignment">Section 6.1</a>. SOSA is also more explicit than SSO in its
      support for virtual and human sensor. Finally,
      and most notably, SOSA extends SSO's original scope beyond sensors and
      their observations by including classes and properties for actuators
      and sampling. SOSA also distinguishes between <code>phenomenonTime</code> and
      <code>resultTime</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Drawing on considerable implementation and application experience with SSN and sensor and observation ontologies
      more broadly, the new SSN and SOSA ontologies presented here are set out to address changes in scope and audience,
      shortcomings of the initial work, as well as new technical developments. The list below highlights the most
      important (but by far not exclusive) updates.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Addressing changes in scope and audience</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The initial SSN was developed with ontology engineers in mind as the primary audience. Due to the
            widespread adoption of SSN, the increasing role of citizen science, the strong focus on lightweight
            vocabularies by the Linked Data community, and vocabularies such as Schema.org, the ontology was
            streamlined. SOSA is added as a core, and is also useful as a standalone ontology targeting Web developers,
            citizen science, lightweight Linked Data publishing, resource-constraint IoT devices, data intensive
            applications (with the possibility of using lightweight reasoning), and so on. The new SSN introduces
            additional classes and relations on top of SOSA to model the capabilities of sensors and actuators, the
            compositionality of systems, and so forth to suit more complex needs or cases in which more provenance data
            is required, e.g., to improve reproducibility. </li>
          <li>Almost all scientific observations make heavy use of sampling strategies, and, therefore, the Sampling,
            Sampler, and Sample classes, as well as their corresponding properties, have been added to SOSA and SSN.
          </li>
          <li>Due to the increasing importance of the Web of Things and smart instrumentation and environments more
            generally, the classes Actuator and Actuation have been added to SOSA and SSN.</li>
        </ul>
      <li><strong>Addressing shortcomings of the initial SSN</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The new SSN streamlines the relations (and need for) the old Device, Platform, and Systems classes.</li>
          <li>The old SSN was perceived as too heavyweight (on its axiomatization) and too dependent on OWL reasoning by
            some users. To strike a balance, DL expressivity of the new lightweight SOSA ontology is ALI(D) which is
            efficiently supported by modern triple stores, while the new SSN is ALRIN(D). In contrast, the old SSN is
            SRIQ.</li>
          <li>The SSN previously imported DUL and many SSN terms inherited from DUL terms. Due to frequent user
            requests, this has been redesigned so that SSN (and SOSA) can be used entirely independently of DUL if
            desired. Some of the alignments with DUL have been reconsidered. Those parts of SSN that use DUL terms have
            been separated into the <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/dul">SSN Alignment with DUL ontology.</a> This
            alignment and therefore the role of DUL in SSN have been declared non-normative.</li>
          <li>The definitions for many classes and properties have changed slightly to improve explanation or to correct
            minor errors. Examples have been separated from the main definitions.</li>
          <li>The initial SSN has been criticized for its partially inconsistent handling of virtual sensors (including
            software and simulations) and related classes and properties. The new SSN and SOSA address this issue by
            allowing all major classes to be virtual, and to better support humans and other animals as agents.</li>
          <li>The notion of Procedure (formerly Plan) has been clarified to describe a workflow, protocol, plan,
            algorithm, or computational method specifying how to make an Observation, create a Sample, or make a change
            to the state of the world via an Actuator.</li>
          <li>The Observation class in the initial SSN was conceptualized as a subclass of the DUL Situation class. To
            improve alignment with O&amp;M and user expectations, as well as to follow a consistent modeling strategy
            for observations, sampling, and actuation, the Observation class defined in SOSA and the new SSN are now
            conceptualized as activities. </li>
        </ul>
      <li><strong>Addressing technical developments</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The initial SSN used local/guarded domain and range restrictions. The lightweight SOSA ontology uses an
            even more restrained axiomatization to foster wide reuse and adaptation among an audience that is not
            necessarily familiar with OWL. SOSA makes use of the <code>domainIncludes</code> and
            <code>rangeIncludes</code> annotation properties defined in Schema.org. These had not been available before.
          </li>
          <li>Given the increased interest in using Semantic Web technologies directly on the level of individual
            sensors, actuators, or platforms, SOSA's axiomatization does not use many of the more complex language
            elements introduced by SSN.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
