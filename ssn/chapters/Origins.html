<h3>Origins of SSN and SOSA</h3>

<h4>OGC Sensor Web Enablement</h4>

<p>
    Starting in 2002, the OGC's Sensor Web Enablement initiative [[SWE]] developed a generic framework for delivering
    sensor data, dealing with remote-sensing, moving platforms, and in-situ monitoring and sensing.
    In particular, the key standards SensorML and O&amp;M provided complementary viewpoints:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>SensorML</b> [[SensorML]] is 'provider-centric' and encodes details of the sensor along with raw observation
        data
    </li>
    <li>
        Observations and Measurements (<b>O&amp;M</b>) [[OandM]] [[iso-19156-2011]] was designed to be more
        'user-centric', with the target of the observation and the observed property as first-class objects.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    O&amp;M also provided a model for sampling, since almost all scientific observations are made on a subset of, or
    proxy for, the ultimate feature of interest.
</p>

<h4>W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator</h4>

<p>
    The initial Semantic Sensor Network ontology - now known as <b>SSNX</b> [[SSNX]] - was developed by the <a
        href="https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/wiki/Main_Page">W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group</a>.
    SSNX was influenced by SWE, but was primarily built around the <em>Stimulus Sensor Observation</em> (<b>SSO</b>)
    ontology design pattern [[SSO-Pattern]].
    The SSO was also aligned to the <em>Dolce-Ultralite</em> upper ontology [[DUL]].
</p>

<h4>SSN Ontology, including SOSA</h4>

<p>
    The <b>SSN Ontology</b> [[vocab-ssn-20171019]] combined key elements of SWE and SSNX, and added Actuation and
    Sampling as additional procedure execution types.
    The core classes and properties comprised the <em>Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator</em> (<b>SOSA</b>)
    module.
    SOSA acts as the central building block for the SSN and is packaged with very lightweight axiomatization so as to
    support use by web-developers.
</p>

<p>For details on the design philosophy and decisions around the SSN Ontology, please consult chapter "3. Origins of
    SSN and SOSA" in [[[vocab-ssn-20171019]]].
</p>

<h4>New editions</h4>

<p>
    Following experience with O&amp;M since its publication as an ISO and OGC standard in 2011 [[OandM]]
    [[iso-19156-2011]], a revised edition <em>Observations, Measurements and Samples</em> (<b>OMS</b>) was developed and
    published in 2023 [[OMS]] [[iso-19156-2023]].
    The new edition notably incorporated the <code>Sampling</code> class from SSN, as well as some features which had
    been proposed in an Extension to SSN [[vocab-ssn-ext-20200116]], in particular the notion of <i>ultimate
        feature-of-interest</i>, as well as Sample and Observation <i>collections</i>.
    Section 7 of [[OMS]] provides a comprehensive description of the characteristics of observations and samples.
</p>

<p class="note">OMS was published by ISO 19156:2023 [[iso-19156-2023]], but is freely available as OGC Abstract
    Specification - Topic 20 [[OMS]].</p>

<p>
    Production of this new edition of the SSN Ontology has been primarily driven by a desire to align with OMS.
    SSN provides the official RDF implementation of OMS, as described in the <a href="#OMS-alignment">OMS Alignment
        Module</a>.
    In addition, developments in <em>Internet of Things</em> implementations, in particular [[SAREF]], [[STA]] and the
    OGC Connected Systems project have contributed some ideas particularly around actuation.
    Finally, direct experience with SSN has uncovered a variety of more minor issues that have been addressed or
    accommodated.
