<h3>Location</h3>
<p>
    Many of the key classes provided by SOSA and SSN represent entities that can be located in space such as
    sensors, features of interest, actuators, samples, or activities that can be located via their participating
    entities, e.g., platforms.
    These entities will usually be described using models and ontologies defined for application domains, including
    technical disciplines, social and business contexts.

<p>
    Standards for spatial properties are discussed in the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices note [[SDW-BP]].
    In particular, GeoSPARQL [[geosparql]] provides a flexible and relatively complete platform for geospatial
    objects, to support interoperability between geo-datasets.
    Using GeoSPARQL, geometries can be assigned to entities using the geo:hasGeometry property.

<h4>Sample with location</h4>
<p>
    For example, if observations are made of the atmosphere at a specific location, it is recommended that this be
    defined as a Sample whose location is given using GeoSPARQL with the following pattern:
