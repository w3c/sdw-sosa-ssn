<h3>Homogeneous collection of observations</h3>

<p>
    A collection of observations may share a common value for one or more of the characteristic observation
    properties.
    For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        many monitoring processes generate a stream of data in which only the (phenomenon-) time changes between
        consecutive results for the same property on a single feature of interest, observed using the same procedure
        implemented using the same sensor.
    </li>
    <li>
        a sensor network typically generates a set of results, over the same time interval, for the same
        property(s), over a suite of features-of-interest.
        Imaging sensors could be considered a special case of this, where the proximate features-of-interest
        correspond with individual pixels in the result.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    These patterns can be accommodated with the class <code>ObservationCollection</code> individuals of which may
    hold one or more of the essential properties of an atomic observation, except for the result.
    Where present, the value of the property(s) of the collection are shared by all member observations.
    Of the essential properties of an observation, only the value of each actual <a
        href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSAhasResult">hasResult</a> is not potentially shared by all member
    observations, though at least one of the other properties would be expected to vary between members in a typical
    collection.
</p>

<p>For example, <a href="#fig-observation-collection-3"></a> describes a collection of remote sensing observations
    using the same sensor on different scenes, while <a href="#fig-observation-collection-4"></a> is a series of the
    same scene on different days. </p>

    <img alt="Collections of observations 4" src="./images/OC-instance-4.png" style="width:90%" />
    <figcaption>A series of remote sensing observations of the same scene on the different days</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    Collections may be nested.
    For example, an outer observation-collection might share the observed-property, procedure and sensor, and
    contain inner observation-collections at different phenomenon-times, each of which contain a set of observations
    on different features-of-interest (<a href="#fig-observation-collection-1"></a>).
</p>

<figure id="fig-observation-collection-1">
    <img alt="Nested collections of observations 1" src="./images/OC-instance-1.png" style="width:90%" />
    <figcaption>Example of a set of nested collections of four observations of the same property of two
        features-of-interest at two different times.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    Observations can be factored into collections in more than one way, so more than one set of nested
    observation-collections can collect the same set of atomic results.
    For example, the same outer collection may contain inner collections concerning different features-of-interests,
    each containing a set of observations at different phenomenon-times (<a href="#fig-observation-collection-2"></a>).
</p>

<figure id="fig-observation-collection-2">
    <img alt="Nested collections of observations 2" src="./images/OC-instance-2.png" style="width:90%" />
    <figcaption>Alternative set of nested collections with the same results of the same property of two
        features-of-interest at two different times.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    Effectively, the results of each observation-collection correspond to a <i>slice</i> in a data-cube which is
    composed of the results of the complete set of observations.
</p>

<p class="note">
    This feature might also apply to collections of <i>Actuations</i> but this application has not yet been
    explored.
