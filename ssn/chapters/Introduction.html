<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  Sensors are a major source of data available on the Web today.
  However, searching, reusing, integrating, and interpreting sensor data requires more than just the sensing results.
  For the proper interpretation of these values, knowledge of the feature of interest, such as a river, the observed
  property, such as flow velocity, the sampling strategy, such as the specific locations and
  times at which the velocity was measured, and a variety of other information are required.
</p>
<p>
  OGC's Sensor Web Enablement standards [[SWE]], [[SensorML]], [[OandM]], [[OMS]], [[STA]] provide
  conceptual models, as well as some encodings for the annotation of sensors and their observations.
  [[OMS]] provides a comprehensive description of the characteristics of observations and samples.
  Integration and alignment of these with W3C Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data embeds this in a global and
  densely interconnected graph of data.
</p>
<p>
  With the rise of the Web of Things and smart cities and homes more generally, actuators and the data they produce
  also become first-class citizens of the Web.
  Given their close relation to sensors and observations, it is desirable to provide an ontology that also includes
  actuators and actuation.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, with the increasing diversity of data and data providers, definitions for sensors need to be broadened, to
  include human agents and social sensing.
</p>
<p>
  This specification defines the Semantic Sensor Network (<b>SSN</b>) ontology.
  It sets out to provide flexible but coherent perspectives for representing the entities, relations, and activities
  involved in sensing, sampling, and actuation.
  A lightweight core for SSN, known as <b>SOSA</b> (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator) aims at broadening the
  target audience and application areas that do not need the full capabilities of Semantic Web ontologies.
  SOSA acts as minimal interoperability fall-back level, i.e., it defines terms (classes and properties) with which
  data can be safely exchanged across all uses of SSN, its modules, and SOSA.
</p>
<p>
  The previous edition of the SSN Ontology [[vocab-ssn-20171019]] harmonised earlier work from OGC ([[OandM]]) and W3C
  ([[SSNX]]) .
  A new edition of the OGC/ISO standard [[[OMS]]] has updated [[[OandM]]] with a number of additional features arising
  from more than 10 years implementation experience.
  <b>This new edition of the SSN Ontology provides a canonical RDF implementation of OMS (the <a href="#OMS">OMS Extension Module</a>).</b>
</p>
<p>
  In addition, developments in <em>Internet of Things</em> implementations have contributed some ideas particularly
  around actuation.
  Finally, direct experience with SSN has uncovered a variety of more minor issues that have been addressed or
  accommodated.

  A <a href="#changes">change log</a> is provided in an Annex of this document.
  This change log describes the changes since the 2017 edition [[vocab-ssn-20171019]].
  For earlier changes during the development of the SSN Ontology, please consult Annex "D. Change History" in
  [[vocab-ssn-20171019]].

<p class="note">
  An <a href="#origins">Annex to this document</a> provides a brief account of the origins of the SSN ontology through
  various OGC and W3C initiatives.
