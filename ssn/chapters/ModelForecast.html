<h3>Forecasts</h3>
<p>
    A forecast may be represented as an observation where the value of <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code> is later in
    time than the <code>sosa:resultTime</code>.
    This means that: The time when the Observation execution was completed is before the time that the Result of the
    observation applies to the FeatureOfInterest.

<p class="note">
    Other means to represent forecasts are reported, but not in the scope of this specification.
    For example [[Lefrancois-et-al-2017]] derives the SSN <code>Sensing/Sensor/Observation</code>
    pattern and define <code>Forecasting/Forecaster/Forecast</code> classes.
