<h3>Ultimate feature of interest</h3>
<p>
    The object of the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSAhasFeatureOfInterest">hasFeatureOfInterest</a> property of an act
    of observation, sampling, or actuation is the <i>immediate</i> or <i>proximate</i>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSAFeatureOfInterest">FeatureOfInterest</a>.
    In some cases this is not the the ultimate thing that the act of observation, sampling, or actuation is
    concerned with, but is an intermediate thing, often a <i>sample</i> of the ultimate feature of interest, or
    perhaps a sample of a sample, etc.
    There will often be a specifiable relationship between the proximate and ultimate feature of interest, such as a
    sampling-chain.
    If this relationship is recorded, then an ultimate feature of interest might be inferred.
    Nevertheless, particularly for discovery purposes, it is usually the ultimate feature of interest that really
    matters to the data user.
    This requirement is satisfied by an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/#Object_Properties">object
        property</a> called <code>hasUltimateFeatureOfInterest</code>.

    Some patterns for the relationship of the ultimate feature of interest to observations (
    <a href="#fig-observation-ultimate-foi"></a>) and acts of sampling (
    <a href="#fig-sampling-ultimate-foi"></a>), and within sampling-chains, are illustrated below.
