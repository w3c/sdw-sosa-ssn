    <p>The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology is an ontology for describing
      sensors and their observations, the involved procedures, the studied features of
      interest, the samples used to do so, and the observed properties, as well as actuators.
      SSN follows a horizontal and vertical modularization architecture, with the core classes
      and properties defined using minimal axiomatization in a graph called SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and
      Actuator)
      supplemented with additional axiomatization and terms in further graphs.
      These allow SSN to support a wide range of applications and use
      cases, including satellite imagery, large-scale scientific monitoring, industrial and
      household infrastructures, social sensing, citizen science, observation-driven ontology
      engineering, and the Web of Things. </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Sensors are a major source of data available on the Web
      today. While sensor data may be published as mere values, searching, reusing, integrating, and interpreting these
      data requires more than just the observation results. Of equal
      importance for the proper interpretation of these values is information
      about the studied feature of interest, such as a river, the observed
      property, such as flow velocity, the utilized sampling strategy, such as
      the specific locations and times at which the velocity was measured, and
      a variety of other information. OGC's Sensor Web Enablement standards
      [[OandM]], [[SensorML]] provide a means to annotate sensors and their
      observations. However, these standards are not integrated and
      aligned with W3C Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data in
      particular, which are key drivers for creating and maintaining a global
      and densely interconnected graph of data. With the rise of the Web of
      Things and smart cities and homes more generally, actuators and the data
      they produce also become first-class citizens of the Web. Given their
      close relation to sensors, observations, procedures, and features of
      interest, it is desirable to provide a common ontology that also
      includes actuators and actuation. Finally, with the increasing diversity
      of data and data providers, definitions such as those for sensors need
      to be broadened, e.g., to include social sensing. The following
      specifications introduce the new Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) and
      Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) ontologies that are set
      out to provide flexible but coherent perspectives for representing the
      entities, relations, and activities involved in sensing, sampling, and
      actuation. SOSA provides a lightweight core for SSN and aims at broadening
      the target audience and application areas that can make use of Semantic Web ontologies.
      At the same time, SOSA acts as minimal interoperability fall-back level, i.e.,
      it defines those common classes and properties for which data can be safely
      exchanged across all uses of SSN, its modules, and SOSA.</p>

  <section id="Modularization" class="informative">
    <h2>Modularization</h2>
    <!--
      <p><span data-dobid="hdw">Practitioners</span> using the original Ontology 
        as defined in the <em>W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group </em> [[SSNX]] identified a major
        issue in its complexity, partly due to the layering underneath the
        Dolce-UltraLite (DUL) upper level ontology. 
        In response to this, the 
        Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology offers several subsets that
        are distinguished through both their scope and their ontological commitments. 
        This
        section explains the rationale and method for modularizing SSN suitable to
        several use cases and target audiences. 
        For example, SOSA is intended 
  to provide Schema.org-style semantic enrichment capabilities for 
  data repositories managed by an audience broader than typical ontology engineers, 
   while still ensuring interoperability with SSN-based repositories.</p>-->
    <p>Ontology modularization is commonly used
      to segment an ontology to provide users with the knowledge
      they require, reducing the scope as much as possible to what is strictly
      necessary in a given use case. </p>
    <!-- Two main categories of ontology
        modularization can be distinguished.</p>
      <p>The first category comprises those approaches that focus on the
        composition of existing ontologies by means of integrating and mapping
        ontologies, most commonly through <code>owl:imports</code> statements.
        OWL import has a direction from a dependent ontology to a dependency
        ontology. Although import is transitive, knowledge is propagated in only
        one direction. The importing ontology assumes all the meaning of the
        imported terms used, by including all axioms relevant to the meaning of
        these terms. However, the imported ontology does not capture any of the
        semantics of the importing ontology.</p>
      <p>The second category comprises of mapping approaches that aim to
        partition and extract parts of ontologies as modules. These mapping
        approaches are not necessarily directional, but most approaches of
        ontology extraction rely on the directionality of the imported modules.
        The main feature of an ontology module under the second category is that
        it is self-contained, i.e., the module captures the meaning of the
        imported terms used by including all axioms relevant to the meaning of
        these terms. This means, that the result of certain reasoning tasks such
        as subsumption or query answering within a single module should be
        possible and result in the same answers without the need to access other
        modules of the ontology.</p>
      <p> Our modularization uses the first approach by composing the -->
    <p>The SSN Ontology is distributed through several modules or graphs that use <code>owl:imports</code>
      statements.
      We distinguish two methods depending on the
      directionality of the segmentation: a vertical segmentation and a
      horizontal segmentation.</p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3 id="vertical-segmentation">Vertical Segmentation</h3>
    <p>Vertical modules build upon each other, i.e., they directionally <code>owl:import</code>
      lower level modules. Lower level modules are independent of their higher
      level modules and logically consistent on their own.</p>
    <p>In particular,</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        the <i>SOSA graph</i> declares all the core classes and properties, and provides textual definitions and other
        annotations.
        Some semantic enrichment is provided using Schema.org properties, but there is no formal axiomatization.
        <b><i>SOSA</i> may be used <i>as-is</i> by an audience who wish to use terminology consistent with the SSN
          Ontology, thus ensuring interoperability with SSN-based repositories</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        the <i>SSN graph</i> imports <i>SOSA</i>, and adds axioms that formally indicate how properties relate to
        classes, how classes relate to each other. <b><i>SSN</i> may be used in semantic web systems that use
          inferencing and reasoning, and consistency checking for datasets</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        the <i>SOSA-OMS graph</i> imports <i>SOSA</i> and describes the alignment of SOSA to [[OMS]], adding some
        additional terms used in OMS that are not otherwise included in SSN. <b><i>SOSA-OMS</i> may be used by audiences
          for whom strict conformance to [[OMS]] (also known as ISO 19156:2023) is a requirement</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        the <i>SSN-OMS graph</i> imports <i>SOSA-OMS</i> and <i>SSN</i> and describes the alignment of SSN to [[OMS]]
        including OWL/RDFS axiomatization. <b><i>SSN-OMS</i> may be used by audiences for whom strict conformance to
          [[OMS]] (also known as ISO 19156:2023) is a requirement, with reasoning support</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        the <i>Dolce-UltraLite Alignment graph</i> imports the <i>SSN graph</i> which itself imports the <i>SOSA
          graph</i>, and adds axioms that position SSN within <i>Dolce-UltraLite</i>. <b><i>DUL-Alignment</i> may be
          used to integrate data designed using SSN into systems otherwise built in the <i>Dolce-UltraLite</i>
          framework</b>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><i>SOSA</i> as the core, does not
      import any other ontologies, so it is truly independent of
      vertical modules that add more expressivity and further ontological
      commitments to the lightweight semantics of <i>SOSA</i>.</p>
    <p class="note">Readers who do not wish to view the SSN axioms may hide them by selecting the button [Show only core
      SOSA terms] at the top of the <a href="#overview-of-classes-and-properties">Overview of Classes and Properties</a>
      or [Hide additional SSN axioms] on each individual specification block.</p>
    <p>Note that higher level here is not to be confused with upper level
      ontologies. Upper level ontologies are general knowledge ontologies that
      can be directionally imported in many domains, whereas our definition of
      higher level ontologies here refers to an ontology that extends one or
      several ontology modules to capture a larger part of a knowledge domain
      and/or combine knowledge domains.</p>
    <h3 id="horizontal-segmentation">Horizontal Segmentation</h3>
    <p>Modules that are horizontally layered may depend on each other, i.e.,
      they may rely on the directional import of another horizontal module.
      Two horizontal modules that are dependent on the SOSA and SSN ontologies are
      presented in this specification,</p>
    <ol>
      <li>the <i>Sample Relations Module</i></li>
      <li>the SSN System module</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Other ontologies that add domain-specific terms to SOSA and SSN, but require the
      import of SOSA or SSN, can be considered horizontal modules.</p>

  <section id="Developments" class="informative">
    <h2>Origins of SSN and SOSA</h2>
    <p>Here we briefly review the origins of SSN and SOSA, namely the initial
      SSN version published by the <em>W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator
        Group </em> [[SSNX]] and work on Sensor Web Enablement by the OGC. We
      also highlight the most substantial changes made since the initial
      release of the SSN ontology.</p>
    <p>Starting in 2002, the OGC's Sensor Web Enablement initiative has developed
      a generic framework for delivering sensor data, dealing with
      remote-sensing, moving platforms, and in-situ monitoring and sensing.
      The Sensor Observation Service defines a standard query interface for
      sensor and observation data, following the pattern established by OGC
      for their Web Services. The returned XML data conforms with the Sensor Model
      Language [[SensorML]] and OMXML [[OMXML]], whereby the latter implements
      Observations and Measurements [[OandM]]. </p>
    <p>SensorML and O&amp;M are complementary viewpoints. SensorML
      is 'provider-centric' and encodes details of the sensor along with raw
      observation data. SensorML is self-contained and highly flexible. This
      makes life easy for data producers but is demanding on consumers.
      SensorML provides extensive support for serialization of numeric data arrays
      and is particularly optimized for data that includes multiple parallel
      streams that must be processed together. For example, the data collected
      by cameras on airborne vehicles must be geo-referenced based on the
      instantaneous position of the platform and orientation of the camera. In
      contrast, O&amp;M was designed to be more 'user-centric' with the target
      of the observation and the observed property as first-class objects.
      O&amp;M works at a higher semantic level than SensorML, but only
      provides abstract classes for sensors, features of interest and
      observable properties, expecting the details to be provided by specific
      applications and domains. O&amp;M also provided a model for sampling,
      since almost all scientific observations are made on a subset of, or
      proxy for, the ultimate feature of interest. </p>
    <p>The initial <em>W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group</em>ontology
      (SSNX) was built around an ontology design pattern called the <em>Stimulus
        Sensor Observation</em> (SSO) pattern [[SSO-Pattern]]. The SSO was
      developed as a minimal and common ground for heavy-weight ontologies
      for the use on the Semantic Sensor Web as well as to explicitly
      address the need for light-weight semantics requested by the Linked
      Data community. The SSO was also aligned to the <em>Dolce-Ultralite </em>upper
      ontology (DUL). </p>
    <p>The SSN ontology described in this document is based on a revised and
      expanded version of this pattern, namely the <em>Sensor, Observation,
        Sample, and Actuator</em> (SOSA) ontology.
      Similar to SSNX, SOSA acts as a central building block for the SSN but puts more
      emphasis on light-weight use and the ability to be used standalone.
      The axiomatization also changed to provide an experience more related
      to Schema.org. Notable differences include the usage of the Schema.org
      <code>domainIncludes</code> and <code>rangeIncludes</code> annotation
      properties that provide an informal semantics compared to the
      inferential semantics of their OWL 2 counterparts. In line with the
      changes implemented for the new SSN, SOSA also drops the direct DUL
      alignment although an optional alignment can be achieved via the
      SSN-DUL alignment provided in <a href="#DUL_Alignment">Section 6.1</a>. SOSA is also more explicit than SSO in its
      support for virtual and human sensor. Finally,
      and most notably, SOSA extends SSO's original scope beyond sensors and
      their observations by including classes and properties for actuators
      and sampling. SOSA also distinguishes between <code>phenomenonTime</code> and
      <code>resultTime</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Drawing on considerable implementation and application experience with SSN and sensor and observation ontologies
      more broadly, the new SSN and SOSA ontologies presented here are set out to address changes in scope and audience,
      shortcomings of the initial work, as well as new technical developments. The list below highlights the most
      important (but by far not exclusive) updates.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Addressing changes in scope and audience</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The initial SSN was developed with ontology engineers in mind as the primary audience. Due to the
            widespread adoption of SSN, the increasing role of citizen science, the strong focus on lightweight
            vocabularies by the Linked Data community, and vocabularies such as Schema.org, the ontology was
            streamlined. SOSA is added as a core, and is also useful as a standalone ontology targeting Web developers,
            citizen science, lightweight Linked Data publishing, resource-constraint IoT devices, data intensive
            applications (with the possibility of using lightweight reasoning), and so on. The new SSN introduces
            additional classes and relations on top of SOSA to model the capabilities of sensors and actuators, the
            compositionality of systems, and so forth to suit more complex needs or cases in which more provenance data
            is required, e.g., to improve reproducibility. </li>
          <li>Almost all scientific observations make heavy use of sampling strategies, and, therefore, the Sampling,
            Sampler, and Sample classes, as well as their corresponding properties, have been added to SOSA and SSN.
          </li>
          <li>Due to the increasing importance of the Web of Things and smart instrumentation and environments more
            generally, the classes Actuator and Actuation have been added to SOSA and SSN.</li>
        </ul>
      <li><strong>Addressing shortcomings of the initial SSN</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The new SSN streamlines the relations (and need for) the old Device, Platform, and Systems classes.</li>
          <li>The old SSN was perceived as too heavyweight (on its axiomatization) and too dependent on OWL reasoning by
            some users. To strike a balance, DL expressivity of the new lightweight SOSA ontology is ALI(D) which is
            efficiently supported by modern triple stores, while the new SSN is ALRIN(D). In contrast, the old SSN is
            SRIQ.</li>
          <li>The SSN previously imported DUL and many SSN terms inherited from DUL terms. Due to frequent user
            requests, this has been redesigned so that SSN (and SOSA) can be used entirely independently of DUL if
            desired. Some of the alignments with DUL have been reconsidered. Those parts of SSN that use DUL terms have
            been separated into the <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/dul">SSN Alignment with DUL ontology.</a> This
            alignment and therefore the role of DUL in SSN have been declared non-normative.</li>
          <li>The definitions for many classes and properties have changed slightly to improve explanation or to correct
            minor errors. Examples have been separated from the main definitions.</li>
          <li>The initial SSN has been criticized for its partially inconsistent handling of virtual sensors (including
            software and simulations) and related classes and properties. The new SSN and SOSA address this issue by
            allowing all major classes to be virtual, and to better support humans and other animals as agents.</li>
          <li>The notion of Procedure (formerly Plan) has been clarified to describe a workflow, protocol, plan,
            algorithm, or computational method specifying how to make an Observation, create a Sample, or make a change
            to the state of the world via an Actuator.</li>
          <li>The Observation class in the initial SSN was conceptualized as a subclass of the DUL Situation class. To
            improve alignment with O&amp;M and user expectations, as well as to follow a consistent modeling strategy
            for observations, sampling, and actuation, the Observation class defined in SOSA and the new SSN are now
            conceptualized as activities. </li>
        </ul>
      <li><strong>Addressing technical developments</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The initial SSN used local/guarded domain and range restrictions. The lightweight SOSA ontology uses an
            even more restrained axiomatization to foster wide reuse and adaptation among an audience that is not
            necessarily familiar with OWL. SOSA makes use of the <code>domainIncludes</code> and
            <code>rangeIncludes</code> annotation properties defined in Schema.org. These had not been available before.
          </li>
          <li>Given the increased interest in using Semantic Web technologies directly on the level of individual
            sensors, actuators, or platforms, SOSA's axiomatization does not use many of the more complex language
            elements introduced by SSN.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

      <aside class="note">
        <p>In previous editions of SSN, the namespace <span class="repeated"

          terms are consolidated into a single namespace. The terms in the <code>sosa:</code> namespaces remain in the
          RDF artefacts to protect backward compatibility of existing deployments, but are marked
          <code>deprecated</code>.

      <h3>RDF distribution</h3>
      <p>
        The SSN Ontology is distributed in several graphs, each packaged as an RDF file.
        Within each graph, where further information (axioms and annotations) is added to an existing term,
        <code>rdfs:isDefinedBy</code> indicates the graph where the term was originally defined.
      </p>
      <p>The first two graphs are specified in <a href="#Specification">this section</a>.</p>
      <h4>SOSA</h4>
      <p>
        The SOSA graph contains the basic definitions of the core terms with minimal axiomatization - only
        <code>rdf:type</code> and <code>owl:inverseOf</code> - together with key annotations <code>rdfs:label</code> ,
        <code>skos:definition</code> , <code>schema:domainIncludes</code> , <code>schema:rangeIncludes</code>, plus
        other annotations as required.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        The SOSA graph is available at <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/">http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>SSN</h4>
      <p>
        The SSN graph contains the full axiomatization of the core terms, importing SOSA and using
        <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>, <code>rdfs:subPropertyOf</code>, <code>owl:Restriction</code> with the various
        associated RDFS and OWL structures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        The SSN graph is available at <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/">http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/</a>.
      </p>
      <p>The next two graphs are specified in the section <a href="#HorizontalSegmentation">Horizontal Segmentation</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>SSN-System</h4>
      <p>
        The SSN-System graph imports SOSA and SSN and contains additional definitions associated with the composition
        and deployment of systems.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        The SSN-System graph is available at <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn-system/">http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn-system/</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>Sample-Relations</h4>
      <p>
        The Sample-Relations graph imports SOSA and contains additional definitions associated with relationships
        between samples.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        The Sample-Relations graph is available at <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/sampling/">http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/sampling/</a>.
      </p>
      <p>The section <a href="#VerticalSegmentation">Vertical Segmentation</a> describes various alignements and
        extensions.</p>
      <h4>SOSA-OMS</h4>
      <p>
        The SOSA-OMS graph describes the alignment of SOSA to ISO 19156:2023 [[OMS]] using annotations to link SOSA
        terms to specific requirements in [[OMS]]. SOSA-OMS imports SOSA and declares additional terms required for OMS.
        <b>This graph is the canonical RDF implementation of OMS.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        The SOSA-OMS graph is available at <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa-oms/">http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa-oms/</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>SSN-OMS</h4>
      <p>
        The SSN-OMS graph describes the alignment of SSN to ISO 19156:2023 [[OMS]] with RDFS/OWL axiomatization. This
        graph imports SSN and SOSA-OMS. <b>This graph is the canonical OWL implementation of OMS.</b>

                    more convenient to use a proxy. Samples are thus artifacts of an observational strategy, and usually
                    have no significant function outside of their role in the observation process. The characteristics
                    of the samples themselves are generally of little interest, except to the manager of a sampling

      <section class="informative" id="Collections-overview">
        <h4>Overview and examples</h4>
        <p>Observations may be packaged in collections, for management and analysis.
          A summary of the range of values for properties of the member observations may be recorded as properties of
          the collection - for example, the set of features of interest for a suite of observations. </p>
        <p>
          Collections of observations that are useful for analysis will typically be homogeneous with respect to one or
          more observation properties - for example, of the same observed-property on the same feature of interest at a
          series of different times.
          Shared properties might be conveniently recorded as properties of the collection as a whole, and these
          properties can then be omitted on the descriptions of the individual member observations.
        </p>
        <p>Actuations may also be packaged in collections. An important case will be where a set of actuations act on
          different properties of the same feature of interest, but other cases also apply.
        </p>
        <p>Similarly, samples are often grouped in collections, for example a set of samples of the same feature or
          entity. </p>
        <p>The results of collections of observations are often packaged in a 'data cube' whose axes define the range of
          properties of the set of observations. </p>
        <p>Three classes representing collections of Actuations or of Observations or of Samples are provided:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#SOSAActuationCollection">sosa:ActuationCollection</a> is a collection of actuations whose
            property values summarize the values of the properties of its members</li>
          <li><a href="#SOSAObservationCollection">sosa:ObservationCollection</a> is a collection of observations whose
            property values summarize the values of the properties of its members</li>
          <li><a href="#SOSASampleCollection">sosa:SampleCollection</a> is a collection of samples whose property values
            summarize the values of the properties of its members</li>
        </ul>

          <p>The following figure provides an overview of the core classes
            and properties that are specifically related to describing collections of observations or of samples.

      <h3>Sample Relations Module</h3>
      <p>Samples are often related to other samples, by sub-sampling,
        topological relationships (stations along a traverse, pixels within an
        image, probe spots on a polished section, specimens retrieved within a
        borehole) or as parts of sample processing chains (crushing,
        splitting, dissecting, disolving). There are an essentially unlimited
        set of relationships between samples, so the nature of the
        relationship has its own class. This section describes a flexible
        model to describe such relationships between samples. The model is
        based on the <a href="http://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/qualified-relation.html">QualifiedRelation
          pattern</a>. </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">The namespace for Sample relationships
        terms is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/sampling/</span>
      </p>
      <p>The suggested prefix for the sample relationships namespace is <span class="repeated"

    <h2>Vertical Segmentation</h2>
    <p>This section introduces the specifications for the vertical segmentation modules that align SOSA and SSN to a
      variety of related ontologies and specifications. </p>
    <section id="OMS_alignment" class="normative">
      <h3>OMS Alignment Module</h3>
      <p class="note">This alignment is marked <i>normative</i> - but maybe it should be <i>informative</i> here and
        owned by the OGC OMS group?</p>
      <p>This section introduces the alignment of SOSA and SSN to Observations, measurements and samples [[OMS]]. OMS is
        the latest edition of the OGC and ISO standard previously known as Observations and Measurements [[OandM]],
        which was a key influence and input in the development of SSN.
        This module serves to provide a detailed mapping of SOSA terms to discrete requirements in [[OMS]] thus
        explaining how SOSA and SSN provide an RDF and OWL/RDFS implementation of OMS (repectively). </p>
      <p>
        Note that [[OMS]] is formalized using UML, which does not provide accessible global identifiers for terms in the
        structure model.
        Here we use the URI for each formal Requirement relating to a class or property in [[OMS]] to denote the UML
        class or property.
        Within the RDF representation of the alignment, we use the predicate <code>ogc-ms:implements</code> to link a
        SOSA term to the corresponding OMS class or property, defined as follows: </p>
      <pre>ogc-ms:implements an OWL:ObjectProperty ;
      rdfs:subPropertyOf dcterms:source , prov:wasDerivedFrom , doap:implements . </pre>

      <h3>PROV Alignment Module</h3>
      <p>This section introduces the alignment of SOSA to W3C PROV ([[prov-overview]], [[prov-dm]], [[prov-o]]).</p>
      <p>The underlying structure of PROV is based around a process-flow model, with three base classes: <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Entity">Entity</a>, which is the class of physical, digital, conceptual,
        or other kinds of things with some fixed aspects; <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Activity">Activity</a>,
        which is the class of things that occur over a period of time and act upon or with entities, and it may include
        consuming, processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities; and <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Agent">Agent</a>, the class of things that bear some form of
        responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity, or for another agent's activity.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Core PROV classes and some of the properties that relate them, shown alongside the core SOSA
          structure for observation, actuation and sampling. Classes generally aligned with prov:Entity in yellow

      </figure>

      <p>The SOSA/SSN ontologies conceive observations, actuations, and acts of sampling as activities or events, that
        results in information being produced, or a change in the world, or the production or transformation of a
        sample.
        Thus, an alignment of SOSA to PROV is natural.
        Compton et al. [[SSN-PROV]] and Cox [[OM-Lite]] have previously described alignments of the SSNX and O&amp;M
        models with [[prov-o]].
        The alignment here is based on that work, also extended to consider actuation. </p>

    <h2>Common Modeling Questions</h2>
    This section informally discusses how to handle common modeling questions such as locations, forecasts, and quantity
    values with a unit of measure.

    <section id="location">
      <h3>Location</h3>
      <p>Many of the key classes provided by SOSA and SSN represent entities that can be located in space
        such as sensors, features of interest, actuators, samples, and so forth, or activities that can be
        located via their participating entities, e.g., platforms. These entities will usually be described using
        models and ontologies defined for application domains, including technical disciplines, social and business
        contexts. In these contexts there are a number of implementations that support the expression of spatial
        properties, including location. These are discussed further in the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices
        note [[SDW-BP]]. </p>
      <p>In particular, GeoSPARQL [[GeoSPARQL]] provides a flexible and relatively complete platform for geospatial
        objects, that fosters interoperability
        between geo-datasets. To do so, these entities can be declared as instances of geo:Feature and geometries can be
        assigned to them via the geo:hasGeometry property. In case of classes, e.g., specific features of
        interests such as rivers, these can be defined as subclasses of geo:Feature.</p>
      <p>For example, if observations are made of the atmosphere at a specific location, it might be described as a
        Sample using the following pattern:</p>
      <pre class="example" data-include="./examples/2023ex1.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

    </section>

    <section id="forecasts" class="informative">
      <h3>Forecasts</h3>
      <p>One may also represent forecasts as observations if the value of <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code>
        is later in time than the <code>sosa:resultTime</code>. Given the
        definition of these terms, it means that: <em>The time when the
          Observation act was completed is before the time that the Result of
          the observation applies to the FeatureOfInterest.</em></p>
      <p class="note"> Other means to represent forecasts are reported, but
        not in the scope of this specification. For example
        [[Lefrancois-et-al-2017]] derives the SSN <code>Sensing/Sensor/Observation</code>
        pattern and define <code>Forecasting/Forecaster/Forecast</code>
        classes.</p>
      <p class="note">Describing a plan for some actuation or observation in
        the future is not covered by this specification.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="quantity-values-and-unit-of-measures" class="informative">
      <h3>Quantity Values and Unit of Measures</h3>
      <p>The result of an <a href="#SOSAObservation"><code>sosa:Observation</code></a> or an <a
          href="#SOSAActuation"><code>sosa:Actuation</code></a> can be a quantity value with a numeric value and a unit
        of measure.

      <p class="note">It is not in the scope of this specification to recommend any particular way of expressing results
        as quantity values.
        There exist external vocabularies that are specifically designed for modeling quantity values as OWL
        individuals, or as datatypes.
        Examples include the Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies (QUDT, [[QUDT]]) the Ontology of
        Units of Measure (OM, [[Rijgersberg-et-al-2013]]), and the St Etienne School of Mines <i>Custom Datatypes</i>
        (CDT, [[CDT]]). </p>
      <ul>
        <li>With QUDT, a quantitative result would be a <a href="http://qudt.org/"><code>qudt:QuantityValue</code></a>
        </li>
        <li>With OM 2, a quantitative result would be a <a
            href="http://www.wurvoc.org/vocabularies/"><code>om:Measure</code> or <code>om:Point</code></a></li>
        <li>With CDT, the value of <a href="#SOSAhasSimpleResult"><code>sosa:hasSimpleResult</code></a> may be
          structured to match <a
            href="https://ci.mines-stetienne.fr/lindt/v4/custom_datatypes#ucum"><code>cdt:ucum</code></a> which encodes
          the unit-of-measure using UCUM (UCUM, [[UCUM]])</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">Custom datatypes are not strictly compatible with OWL, which restricts the set of datatypes that
        can be used. See sec. 5.2 in [[owl2-syntax]] for more details.</p>

      <p>This specification does not specify whether an instance of <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a>

        <code>ex:LightActuator</code>), or specific to a single feature of interest (e.g.,
        <code>&lt;temperatureSensor/84&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;light/112&gt;</code>).
        Implementers are free to choose one way of modeling things or the other.

      <p>On the other hand, one SHOULD NOT use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/#F12:_Punning">OWL
          punning</a> to make <code>ex:Temperature</code> denote both a subclass of
        <a href="#SOSAProperty"><code>sosa:Property</code></a> and an instance of sosa:Property. In fact, merging the
        two examples below in a
        single RDF Graph would make an OWL reasoner infer that <code>ex:TemperatureSensor</code>,
        <code>&lt;TemperatureSensor/1&gt;</code>, and
        <code>&lt;TemperatureSensor/2&gt;</code>, denote the same individual.
      </p>

        <p>In order to characterize a thing with a large extent, or which is not directly accessible, the usual
          observational strategy is to obtain one or more samples. Observations may then be made more conveniently on
          the samples, with the intention of characterizing the larger thing. This intentionality is captured using the
          property <code>sosa:isSampleOf</code>. </p>
        <p>In the following example, the ice core is a sample of the Antarctic ice sheet, and observations are made on
          the ice core. </p>
        <p>A convenient side effect of this feature is that all observations related to the larger thing (the ice sheet)
          can be found, and then potentially joined together in a meta-analysis in order to characterize that. </p>

    <ol>
      <li>The DUL ontology, that was imported in SSN, is no
        longer imported and all axioms using terms from DUL have been
        removed from SSN and collected in the DUL-SSN alignment module. </li>
      <li>The namespace was changed to match the planned namespace for this
        publication. </li>
      <li>The modularization as presented here, including the core, is
        entirely new. </li>
    </ol>

        (http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-vocab-ssn-20160531/)</a></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Correction to include some SSN terms that were unintentionally
        dropped from the FPWD. Correction to remove an asserted subclass of
        owl:Thing that was introduced into FPWD (these were both by-products
        of the DUL removal). </li>
      <li>Correction to some https namespace usage that crept into the FPWD.</li>
      <li>Transition to the new namespace used by the DUL module.</li>
      <li>Inclusion of the DUL alignment and the old SSN (of the SSN-XG)
        alignment. </li>
      <li> sosa:Sensor has been changed to be a subclass of dul:Object
        instead of dul:Physical Object.</li>
      <li>Various typography and spelling errors and consistency of
        expression in annotation properties have been improved. These do not
        induce any changes in the intended meaning of the terms. </li>
      <li>Specgen 6 has been used to generate the ontology documentation.
        The popular sketch of SSN structure has been removed. </li>
      <li>Object properties sosa:isValueOf, sosa:produces and
        sosa:featureInObservation, along with a propertychain subproperty of
        produces and another propertychain subproperty of hasProperty, were
        introduced unintentionally in the FPWD.</li>
