          In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR"
            title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a

            implementations</a> of each of feature defined in the specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for
          implementers, Web authors, and end users.
        </p>
        <p>
          There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts,
          including ways specification features can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximising
          accessibility in implementations.
        </p>
        <p>
          To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>
          For all specifications, this SSN Ontology Working Group will seek

          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest
          Groups, and with the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a> and the
          <a href="https://www.ogc.org/about-ogc/committees/" title="OGC Architecture Board">OAB</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.
          The SSN Ontology Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups
          throughout development of each specification.
          The SSN Ontology Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is
          encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification
          following a review.
        </p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the

          <h3 id="background-coordination">Background</h3>
          <p>The SSN Ontology Working Group is a W3C entity matched by a Standards Working Group of OGC's Technical
            Committee.
            Collectively, the two comprise the Joint W3C/OGC Organizing Committee, the JWOC.
            This effort exists to facilitate direct cooperation between the spatial information and Web communities,
            allowing each to benefit from the other's data, technologies and methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            The SSN Ontology WG will coordinate between OGC and W3C on shared interests and raise awareness of their
            complementary strengths (e.g. Web scale architecture, accessibility, privacy, internationalisation,
            geospatial expertise, sensors), and will monitor and liaise between groups from OGC and W3C.</p>

            Group.
            The OGC Architecture Board (OAB), comparable to the W3C Technical Advisory Group (TAG) will provide high
            level guidance to the SSN Ontology Working Group.

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this SSN Ontology Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its
          duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and
          Test Leads for each specification.
          The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week
          towards the Working Group.
          There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as
          described in

        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement
          to the terms of the

        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the W3C

          Technical discussions for this SSN Ontology Working Group are conducted in
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>:
          the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and
          technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by
          the general public.
          Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit
          direct public contribution requests.
          The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and
          meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/ssn/">SSN Ontology Working Group home
            page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most SSN Ontology Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and
          will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list
          <a id="public-sdw-wg" href="mailto:public-sdw-wg@w3.org">public-sdw-wg@w3.org</a> (<a

          and on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/sdw-sosa-ssn/issues">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the
          Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such
          a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>).
          Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
          members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful
          consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision
          along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication
          decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based
          survey), with a response period from <span id="cfc"> one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the
          chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be
          considered to have consensus as a resolution of the SSN Ontology Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes
          available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and
          includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
